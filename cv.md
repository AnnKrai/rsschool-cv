```
function calculateArea (r) {
    var area;
    if (r <= 0) {
        return 0;
        } 
        else {
            area = Math.PI * r * r;
            return area;
        }
}
```

## Languages
* Russian!  I know Russian perfectly, because it is great and powerful and it's my native language.
* English! 5 years ago I took an English course (pre-Intermediate). But I forgot everything! So, Google is my best friend-translator assistant!!!
